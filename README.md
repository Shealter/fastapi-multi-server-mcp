## Usage

To use the FastAPI Multi-Server MCP, navigate to the following URL in your browser:

```

```

This will take you to the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI. You can explore the available endpoints and test them directly from the browser.

### Starting a Server

To start a new MCP server, you can use the command line interface. For example:

```bash
python start_server.py --name server1 --port 8001
```

This command starts a new server named `server1` on port `8001`. You can replace `server1` and `8001` with your desired names and ports.

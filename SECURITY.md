## Best Practices for Users

*   **API Key Security**: Your DeepL API key is sensitive information. Do not expose it in public repositories or client-side code. Use environment variables or secure configuration management for storing and accessing the API key.
*   **Network Security**: When deploying the server, ensure it is running in a secure environment. Limit network access to only trusted sources and consider using firewalls and other security measures.
*   **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update the project's dependencies to benefit from security fixes in underlying libraries.

Thank you for helping to keep the DeepL MCP Server secure.
